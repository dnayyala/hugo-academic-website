abstract: DNA methylation is a well-established epigenetic mark, whose pattern
  throughout the genome, especially in the promoter or CpG islands, may be
  modified in a cell at a disease stage. Recently developed probabilistic
  approaches allow distributing methylation signals at nucleotide resolution
  from MethylCap-seq data. Standard statistical methods for detecting
  differential methylation suffer from ‘curse of dimensionality’ and sparsity in
  signals, resulting in high false-positive rates. Strong correlation of signals
  between CG sites also yields spurious results. In this article, we review
  applicability of high-dimensional mean vector tests for detection of
  differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and compare and contrast such tests
  with other methods for detecting DMRs. Comprehensive simulation studies are
  conducted to highlight the performance of these tests under different
  settings. Based on our observation, we make recommendations on the optimal
  test to use. We illustrate the superiority of mean vector tests in detecting
  cancer-related canonical gene pathways, which are significantly enriched for
  acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian cancer.
