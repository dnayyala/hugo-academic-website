abstract: Resting State Network (RSN) analysis investigates spontaneous brain activity
  when the brain is not subjected to any external stimuli. The interest in RSN analysis
  lies primarily in understanding the interaction between different brain regions
  that occur while the brain is “at rest”, i.e., not prompted by external tasks. The
  network of brain regions involved and their activity during the resting state has
  been found to be consistent across broad population and thus could be helpful in
  identifying aberrations in individual brains or effects of particular adverse events.
  Testing for functional consistency in RSN requires analysis of time series patterns
  for multiple time series signal emanating from the different brain regions. An approach
  for studying reproducibility is testing for stability in the cross-correlations
  function of the multiple time series signal. However, often the testing procedures
  do not adequately account for the temporal dependence in the signal and may lead
  to erroneous conclusion, particularly in the presence of confounder such as scan-to-scan
  and visit-to-visit variation. In this article, we develop a general paradigm for
  testing for such confounder in the cross-correlation analysis. Merit of the proposal
  is demonstrated via simulation and the proposed test is shown to have reasonable
  type I error and power under a variety of dependence structures for the multivariate
  signals. The methodology is then applied to the motivating data set involving a
  motor network and it is shown that unless properly controlled, confounders can significantly
  affect the test of reproducibility of the network. Once the analysis is adjusted
  for confounders, the findings reaffirm the conventional wisdom about reproducibility
  of RSN.
