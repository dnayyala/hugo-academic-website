abstract: Resting State Network (RSN) analysis investigates spontaneous brain
  activity when the brain is not subjected to any external stimuli. The interest
  in RSN analysis lies primarily in understanding the interaction between
  different brain regions that occur while the brain is “at rest”, i.e., not
  prompted by external tasks. The network of brain regions involved and their
  activity during the resting state has been found to be consistent across broad
  population and thus could be helpful in identifying aberrations in individual
  brains or effects of particular adverse events. Testing for functional
  consistency in RSN requires analysis of time series patterns for multiple time
  series signal emanating from the different brain regions. An approach for
  studying reproducibility is testing for stability in the cross-correlations
  function of the multiple time series signal. However, often the testing
  procedures do not adequately account for the temporal dependence in the signal
  and may lead to erroneous conclusion, particularly in the presence of
  confounder such as scan-to-scan and visit-to-visit variation. In this article,
  we develop a general paradigm for testing for such confounder in the
  cross-correlation analysis. Merit of the proposal is demonstrated via
  simulation and the proposed test is shown to have reasonable type I error and
  power under a variety of dependence structures for the multivariate signals.
  The methodology is then applied to the motivating data set involving a motor
  network and it is shown that unless properly controlled, confounders can
  significantly affect the test of reproducibility of the network. Once the
  analysis is adjusted for confounders, the findings reaffirm the conventional
  wisdom about reproducibility of RSN.
