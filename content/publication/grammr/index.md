abstract: "Motivation: Microbiota compositions have great implications in human
  health, such as obesity and other conditions. As such, it is of great
  importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover community
  substructures. Graphical representation of metagenomic count data relies on
  two aspects, measure of dissimilarity between samples/taxa and algorithm used
  to estimate coordinates to study microbiota communities. UniFrac is a
  dissimilarity measure commonly used in metagenomic research, but it requires a
  phylogenetic tree. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a popular algorithm
  for estimating two-dimensional (2D) coordinates for graphical representation,
  although alternative and higher-dimensional representations may reveal
  underlying community substructures invisible in 2D representations.Results: We
  adapt a new measure of dissimilarity, penalized Kendall’s τ-distance, which
  does not depend on a phylogenetic tree, and hence more readily applicable to a
  wider class of problems. Further, we propose to use metric multidimensional
  scaling (MDS) as an alternative to PCoA for graphical representation. We then
  devise a novel procedure for determining the number of clusters in conjunction
  with PAM (mPAM). We show superior performances with higher-dimensional
  representations. We further demonstrate the utility of mPAM for accurate
  clustering analysis, especially with higher-dimensional MDS models.
  Applications to two human microbiota datasets illustrate greater insights into
  the subcommunity structure with a higher-dimensional analysis.Availability and
  implementation: GrammR is implemented as an R-package available at
