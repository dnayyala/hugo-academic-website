abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of testing the mean vector in
  the multivariate setting where the dimension p is greater than the sample size
  n, namely a large p and small n problem. We propose a new scalar transform
  invariant test and show the asymptotic null distribution and power of the
  proposed test under weaker conditions than Srivastava (2009). We also present
  numerical studies including simulations and a real example of microarray data
  with comparison to existing tests developed for a large p and small n problem.
