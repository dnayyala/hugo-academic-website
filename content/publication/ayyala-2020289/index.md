abstract: In modern-day analytics, there is ever-growing need to develop
  statistical models to study large data sets, i.e., high-dimensional data.
  Between dimension reduction, asymptotics-driven methods and random
  projection-based methods, there are several approaches developed so far. For
  high-dimensional parametric models, estimation and hypothesis testing for mean
  and covariance matrices have been extensively studied. However, the practical
  implementation of these methods is fairly limited and is primarily restricted
  to researchers involved in high-dimensional inference. With several applied
  fields such as genomics, metagenomics and social networking, high-dimensional
  inference is a key component of big data analytics. In this chapter, a
  comprehensive overview of high-dimensional inference and its applications in
  data analytics is provided. Key theoretical developments and computational
  tools are presented, giving readers an in-depth understanding of challenges in
  big data analysis.
