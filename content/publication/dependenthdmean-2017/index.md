abstract: When testing for the mean vector in a high-dimensional setting, it is
  generally assumed that the observations are independently and identically
  distributed. However if the data are dependent, the existing test procedures
  fail to preserve type I error at a given nominal significance level. We
  propose a new test for the mean vector when the dimension increases linearly
  with sample size and the data is a realization of an M-dependent stationary
  process. The order M is also allowed to increase with the sample size.
  Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is derived by extending the Central
  Limit Theorem for M-dependent processes using two-dimensional triangular
  arrays. The cost of ignoring dependence among observations is assessed in
  finite samples through simulations.
