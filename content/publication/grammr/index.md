abstract: 'Motivation: Microbiota compositions have great implications in human health,
  such as obesity and other conditions. As such, it is of great importance to cluster
  samples or taxa to visualize and discover community substructures. Graphical representation
  of metagenomic count data relies on two aspects, measure of dissimilarity between
  samples/taxa and algorithm used to estimate coordinates to study microbiota communities.
  UniFrac is a dissimilarity measure commonly used in metagenomic research, but it
  requires a phylogenetic tree. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a popular
  algorithm for estimating two-dimensional (2D) coordinates for graphical representation,
  although alternative and higher-dimensional representations may reveal underlying
  community substructures invisible in 2D representations.Results: We adapt a new
  measure of dissimilarity, penalized Kendall’s τ-distance, which does not depend
  on a phylogenetic tree, and hence more readily applicable to a wider class of problems.
  Further, we propose to use metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) as an alternative
  to PCoA for graphical representation. We then devise a novel procedure for determining
  the number of clusters in conjunction with PAM (mPAM). We show superior performances
  with higher-dimensional representations. We further demonstrate the utility of mPAM
  for accurate clustering analysis, especially with higher-dimensional MDS models.
  Applications to two human microbiota datasets illustrate greater insights into the
  subcommunity structure with a higher-dimensional analysis.Availability and implementation:
