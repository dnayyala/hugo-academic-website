Testing equality of mean vectors is a very commonly used criterion when comparing two multivariate random variables. Traditional tests such as Hotellingâ€™s $T^2$ become either unusable or output small power when the number of variables is greater than the combined sample size. This package implements a new test procedure developed using pre-pivoting and Edgeworth expansion for testing the equality of two population mean vectors in the "large p, small n" setting. An illustration of the test procedure is provided and the method is applied to analyze the colorectal cancer gene expression data set from Alon et al. (1999).
