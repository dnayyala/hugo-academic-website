abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of testing the mean vector in the
  multivariate setting where the dimension p is greater than the sample size n, namely
  a large p and small n problem. We propose a new scalar transform invariant test
  and show the asymptotic null distribution and power of the proposed test under weaker
  conditions than Srivastava (2009). We also present numerical studies including simulations
  and a real example of microarray data with comparison to existing tests developed
  for a large p and small n problem.
