I am a biostatistician and data scientist, interested in applying statistical methods to problems in clincal trials, genomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics. I am currently a Senior Manager in Statistical and Quantitative Sciences division at Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Previously, I worked as an Assistant professor of Biostatistics and Data Science in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.

My main research interests include high dimensional statistical inference, with applications in genomics and epigenomics. I am also interested in applying and developing deep learning methods to biomedical data sets.
