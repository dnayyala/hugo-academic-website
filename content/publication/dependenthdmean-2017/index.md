abstract: When testing for the mean vector in a high-dimensional setting, it is generally
  assumed that the observations are independently and identically distributed. However
  if the data are dependent, the existing test procedures fail to preserve type I
  error at a given nominal significance level. We propose a new test for the mean
  vector when the dimension increases linearly with sample size and the data is a
  realization of an M-dependent stationary process. The order M is also allowed to
  increase with the sample size. Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is derived
  by extending the Central Limit Theorem for M-dependent processes using two-dimensional
  triangular arrays. The cost of ignoring dependence among observations is assessed
  in finite samples through simulations.
