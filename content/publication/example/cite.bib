  abstract  = {Resting State Network (RSN) analysis investigates spontaneous brain activity when the brain is not subjected to any external stimuli. The interest in RSN analysis lies primarily in understanding the interaction between different brain regions that occur while the brain is “at rest”, i.e., not prompted by external tasks. The network of brain regions involved and their activity during the resting state has been found to be consistent across broad population and thus could be helpful in identifying aberrations in individual brains or effects of particular adverse events. Testing for functional consistency in RSN requires analysis of time series patterns for multiple time series signal emanating from the different brain regions. An approach for studying reproducibility is testing for stability in the cross-correlations function of the multiple time series signal. However, often the testing procedures do not adequately account for the temporal dependence in the signal and may lead to erroneous conclusion, particularly in the presence of confounder such as scan-to-scan and visit-to-visit variation. In this article, we develop a general paradigm for testing for such confounder in the cross-correlation analysis. Merit of the proposal is demonstrated via simulation and the proposed test is shown to have reasonable type I error and power under a variety of dependence structures for the multivariate signals. The methodology is then applied to the motivating data set involving a motor network and it is shown that unless properly controlled, confounders can significantly affect the test of reproducibility of the network. Once the analysis is adjusted for confounders, the findings reaffirm the conventional wisdom about reproducibility of RSN.},

However if the data are dependent, the existing test procedures fail to preserve type I error at a given nominal significance level. We propose a new test for the mean vector when the dimension increases linearly with sample size and the data is a realization of an M-dependent stationary process. The order M is also allowed to increase with the sample size. Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is derived by extending the Central Limit Theorem for M-dependent processes using two-dimensional triangular arrays. The cost of ignoring dependence among observations is assessed in finite samples through simulations.},

  abstract = {{DNA methylation is a well-established epigenetic mark, whose pattern throughout the genome, especially in the promoter or CpG islands, may be modified in a cell at a disease stage. Recently developed probabilistic approaches allow distributing methylation signals at nucleotide resolution from MethylCap-seq data. Standard statistical methods for detecting differential methylation suffer from ‘curse of dimensionality’ and sparsity in signals, resulting in high false-positive rates. Strong correlation of signals between CG sites also yields spurious results. In this article, we review applicability of high-dimensional mean vector tests for detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and compare and contrast such tests with other methods for detecting DMRs. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to highlight the performance of these tests under different settings. Based on our observation, we make recommendations on the optimal test to use. We illustrate the superiority of mean vector tests in detecting cancer-related canonical gene pathways, which are significantly enriched for acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian cancer.}},

  abstract = {{Motivation: Microbiota compositions have great implications in human health, such as obesity and other conditions. As such, it is of great importance to cluster samples or taxa to visualize and discover community substructures. Graphical representation of metagenomic count data relies on two aspects, measure of dissimilarity between samples/taxa and algorithm used to estimate coordinates to study microbiota communities. UniFrac is a dissimilarity measure commonly used in metagenomic research, but it requires a phylogenetic tree. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is a popular algorithm for estimating two-dimensional (2D) coordinates for graphical representation, although alternative and higher-dimensional representations may reveal underlying community substructures invisible in 2D representations.Results: We adapt a new measure of dissimilarity, penalized Kendall’s τ-distance, which does not depend on a phylogenetic tree, and hence more readily applicable to a wider class of problems. Further, we propose to use metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) as an alternative to PCoA for graphical representation. We then devise a novel procedure for determining the number of clusters in conjunction with PAM (mPAM). We show superior performances with higher-dimensional representations. We further demonstrate the utility of mPAM for accurate clustering analysis, especially with higher-dimensional MDS models. Applications to two human microbiota datasets illustrate greater insights into the subcommunity structure with a higher-dimensional analysis.Availability and implementation: GrammR is implemented as an R-package available at http://www.stat.osu.edu/∼statgen/SOFTWARE/GrammR/.

For high-dimensional parametric models, estimation and hypothesis testing for mean and covariance matrices have been extensively studied. However, the practical implementation of these methods is fairly limited and is primarily restricted to researchers involved in high-dimensional inference. With several applied fields such as genomics, metagenomics and social networking, high-dimensional inference is a key component of big data analytics. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of high-dimensional inference and its applications in data analytics is provided. Key theoretical developments and computational tools are presented, giving readers an in-depth understanding of challenges in big data analysis.},
